# Chinese Comics in Translation

## A Word or Two About Translating Lianhuanhua

To provide contemporary readers and researchers with a glimpse into the vast Chinese comic culture, the ChinaComx project publishes a number of exemplary lianhuanhua from the Mao and early post-Mao years with English translations on this webpage. We hope that these translations will spur further interest and research into this diverse, relevant and, very often, entertaining medium.

During the Mao years, Beijing Foreign Languages Publishing House published translations of comics into various foreign languages. In addition, the 1970s saw a few translations published outside China (most notably a translation into Italian published by Gino Nebiolo et al and retranslated into English and German; and a translation of excerpts of lianhuanhua into German prepared by Wolfgang Bauer):

- *I Fumetti di Mao* (edited by Nebiolo, Gino, Jean Chesneaux, Umberto Eco), Bari: Laterza & Figli, 1971.

- *Das Mädchen aus der Volkskommune* (translated from Italian by Arno Widman, with an introduction by Gino Nebiolo and commentaries by Jean Chesneaux and Umberto Eco): Reinbek: Rowohlt, 1971.

- *The People's Comic Book: Red Women's Detachment, Hot on the Trail and Other Chinese Comics* (translated from Italian by Endymion Wilkinson and Frances Frenaye, with an introduction by Gino Nebiolo), New York: Anchor Press, 1972.

- *Chinesische Comics: Gespenster, Mörder, Klassenfeinde* (translated and edited by Wolfgang Bauer), Düsseldorf: Eugen Diederichs Verlag, 1976.
