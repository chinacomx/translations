# Chinese Comics in Translation

To provide contemporary readers and researchers with a glimpse into the vast Chinese comic culture, the ChinaComx project publishes a number of exemplary lianhuanhua from the Mao and early post-Mao years with English translations on this webpage. We hope that these translations will spur further interest and research into this diverse, relevant and, very often, entertaining medium.

## Our translation philosophy and choices

Our aim in these translations is to make lianhuanhua available to readers who do not read Chinese themselves. The collection thus is conceptualized in broad terms, offering you lianhuanhua from different periods, about different topics, and in different styles to showcase a widest possible spectrum of lianhuanhua production. We will translate both some of the most well-known and widely-read titles as well as those more obscure, unknown, and otherwise untypical. We also chose to refer to *lianhuanhua* 连环画 simply as lianhuanhua - rather than as "picture stories," "serial pictures," or "Chinese comics" - to both highlight the variety of visual-textual forms that lianhuanhua containes, but also to avoid their definitive categorizing.

We take care to keep our translations as close to the Chinese original as possible, i.e. we privilege faithfulness to the original over elegance in the translated text. Yet, we still want to give readers a feeling of the distinct linguistic style in lianhuanhua, which were normatively catering to readers not fully literate and thus often in simple language and clear and short sentences. Acknowledging the highly political language in many lianhuanhua (in particular, in those published in the high-Maoist era and during the Cultural Revolution), we also strive to translate selected political terms uniquely not only within singular texts, but also across the entire collection. Here, we opt for those translations that are closest in concept to the official line of the CCP at the time as well as following current state of the field usage. 

At the same time, beyond common political and ideological terms or names of institutions, we do not force a website-wide standardization of the translations. This ensures that our translators can keep their own voice and also does justice to the different styles of the individual lianhuanhua. As we are funded by the European Research Council and want to represent the linguistic diversity of the continent and of our team, we also will translate into different European languages (for now: English and German, with translations into French, Slovenian, Spanish, Polish, and more all in the works). 

Quite a few lianhuanhua employ quotations, very often from authoritative figures – and mostly of Mao Zedong. For such, we tend to make use of extant translations. In order to capture the authoritative voice of Mao quotations in particular, we reference the relevant fragments as rendered in the officially published translations of Mao’s (and others) texts by the Foreign Language Press, and as also found on the web (e.g., on marxists.org). In other cases, when the lianhuanhua is based on a translated text itself, we consult the extant English translations and/or the original source text. In all these instances, we provide detailed bibliographical references and/or website links.

All translations presented on this website arise from decisions taken in group discussion and in collaborative translation processes. In doing so, we are joining the ranks of other recent collaborative translation initiatives, such as [Reading the China Dream](https://www.readingthechinadream.com/) or [Revisiting the Revolution](https://networks.h-net.org/group/pages/20033515/revisiting-revolution). We hope you enjoy reading these lianhuanhua in translation – and ask you to bear in mind that these are for educational and research purposes only. 

## Extant and new lianhuanhua translations

During the Mao years, the Foreign Languages Press in Beijing published translations of picture stories and lianhuanhua into English and other foreign languages. Many of these can still be found today in library collections or online repositories (e.g., [here](https://www.bannedthought.net/China/MaoEra/)).

In addition, the 1970s also saw a few independent translations published outside China, most notably in the form of an Italian book published by Gino Nebiolo et al that was then retranslated into English and German; similar translations of excerpts of lianhuanhua into German were also prepared by Wolfgang Bauer and Christoph Harbsmeier:

- *I Fumetti di Mao* (edited by Nebiolo, Gino, Jean Chesneaux, Umberto Eco), Bari: Laterza & Figli, 1971.

- *Das Mädchen aus der Volkskommune* (translated from Italian by Arno Widman, with an introduction by Gino Nebiolo and commentaries by Jean Chesneaux and Umberto Eco): Reinbek: Rowohlt, 1971.

- *The People's Comic Book: Red Women's Detachment, Hot on the Trail and Other Chinese Comics* (translated from Italian by Endymion Wilkinson and Frances Frenaye, with an introduction by Gino Nebiolo), New York: Anchor Press, 1972.

- *Chinesische Comics. Gespenster, Mörder, Klassenfeinde* (translated and edited by Wolfgang Bauer), Düsseldorf: Eugen Diederichs Verlag, 1976.

- *Konfuzius und der Räuber Zhi. Neue chinesische Bildergeschichten* (translated and edited by Christoph Harbsmeier), Frankfurt: Insel Verlag, 1978.
