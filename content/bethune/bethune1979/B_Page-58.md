(58) The fierce battle lasted until dawn the next day, when the enemy retreated across the line. Our Captain Xu, who was in charge of blocking the gap, discovered that a group of enemy troops had seized a small hill, threatening our position blocking the gap. He led his soldiers out of the fortifications and wanted to retake the hill from the side.
