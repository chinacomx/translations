【毛主席语录】
白求恩同志是加拿大共产党员，五十多岁了，为了帮助中国的抗日战争，受加拿大共产党和美国共产党的派遣，不远万里，来到中国。去年春上到延安，后来到五台山工作，不幸以身殉职。一个外国人，毫无利己的动机，把中国人民的解放事业当作他自己的事业，这是什么精神？这是国际主义的精神，这是共产主义的精神，每一个中国共产党员都要学习这种精神。

Quotation by Chairman Mao:
“Comrade Bethune, a member of the Communist Party of Canada, was over fifty when he was sent by the Communist Parties of Canada and the United States to aid China’s War of Resistance. He arrived in Yan’an in the spring of last year and later worked in Wutai Mountain, where he unfortunately died at his post. A foreigner, with no selfish motives but wholeheartedly dedicating himself to the liberation of the Chinese people—what kind of spirit is this? It is the spirit of internationalism, the spirit of communism. Every Chinese Communist must learn from this spirit.”
