（113）白求恩在前沿孙家庄小庙设立战地手术室。这里临近火线，不时传来“隆隆”炮声和清脆的机枪声。白求恩组织几个医生到大路口检查每一副过路担架：凡伤轻的，就地包扎；伤重的，全部送到庙里抢救。

(113) Bethune established a frontline operating theater in the small temple of Sunjiazhuang village. It was close to the firing line, and from time to time, the “rumbling” sound of the artillery and the crisp sound of machine guns could be heard. Bethune organized several doctors to check every passing stretcher at the major intersection: those with minor injuries were bandaged on the spot, while critical cases were rushed to the temple for emergency surgery.
