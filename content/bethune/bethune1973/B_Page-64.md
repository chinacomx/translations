（64）回到村里，白求恩向老乡借了“粪驮子”来研究，设计了一种“药驮子”。这种工具用木板做成，外形象一座桥，两边各有三个抽屉，用两头骡子驮运，能装上一个手术室，一个换药室，一个药房的全部用品。

(64) After returning to the village, Bethune borrowed the “dung carrier” from the villager to study it and designed a “medical carrier”. This tool was made of wooden boards and resembled a bridge in shape, with three drawers on each side. Carried by two mules, it could accommodate all the supplies needed for an operating room, a treatment room and a pharmacy.
